  Install the includes (the content of diet/include)

- 2006-01-20-b Raphelkiller: 
  Do not install the examples.

- 2006-01-20-c Cedric Tedeschi: 
  For ctesting of the JXTA part: just RTFM !

- 2006-01-20-d Raphelkiller: 
  Default compile mode should be -O2 -g i.e. CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = RELWITHDEBINFO

- 2006-01-20-e Raphelkiller: 
  How come we get to compile src/utils/Cori_*.cc even when HAVE_CORI is
  not set.

- 2006-01-20-f:
  Put some info in the README on how to transport the CMakeCache.txt from
  a machine to another in order to a single configuration in the context
  of a grid of similar machines...

- When an OMNIORB4_DIR is given (either on command line or in ccmake's GUIs)
  and when this fails, do not fold back to some default version.
  In other words, cmake expected behavior is to do what it was told to and
  nothing more:
   * in non-interactive mode when a path to a specified package is broken
     then stop and report the error.

- In non-interactive mode, provide a digest of the discovered sub-packages
  (and corresponding path).

- See if they are any equivalent of autotools "make distrib" packaging
  target utility.
