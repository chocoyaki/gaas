Compiling and installing DIET with cmake:

I/ Cmake general information, references and docs:
  Entry point:   http://www.cmake.org
  Official docs: http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Documentation.html
  Wiki docs:     http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake
  FAQ:           http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_FAQ
  Google with the command your are looking for as key (avoid cmake as keyword).

II/ For the impatients:
  cd GRAAL/devel/diet/diet/Bin
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/tmp -DDIET_USE_JXTA:BOOL=ON
  make
  make install

III/ Requirements:
  Obtain and install the current version of cmake from 
     http://cmake.kitware.org/
  Alltough the various binary packages are not available on this site
  apt-get is generally cmake aware. By default fetching the sources
  compilation and installation of cmake should be straightfoward.

IV/ Generating the Makefiles:
  Two ways for setting configuration parameters in order to to generate the
  Makefiles:
   - ccmake [options] <path-to-source>
     specify the parameters interactively through a GUI interface
   - cmake [options] <path-to-source> [-D<var>:<type>=<value>]
     specify the parameters on the command line ( cmake -i [*] = ccmake [*] ).

  For both commands:
   - <path-to-source> specifes a path to the top level of the source tree
     (where the top level CMakeLists.txt file is to be encountered),
   - the current working directory will be used as the build tree for
     the  project. Out of source building is generaly prefered (specially
     when working on a CVS tree).
  
  ccmake interface tips:
   - look for the bottom of the interface were ccmake shortcuts are recalled,
   - moving up/down the paramater list with up/down arrows keys
   - hitting h on a parameter pops up the documentation for that parameter
     and general ccmake documentation and keyboard shortcuts (hit e to exit)
   - hit t for displaying cmake advanced parameters
   - when editing a PATH parameter the <TAB> key provides the "usual"
     (for emacs or bash users) automatic path completion

  cmake internal worth mentioning parameters:
   - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE set to Debug for producing debugging information
   - CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE set to ON will generate makefiles without
        the .SILENT directive (usefull for watching the invoked commands
        and their arguments)
   - CMAKE_C[XX]_FLAGS* for customized setting of C/C++ compiler options

V/ the DIET case:
   - assume CVS_DIET_HOME refers to the directory GRAAL/devel/diet/diet
     of a cvs checkout of the DIET sources hierarchy. CVS_DIET_HOME is
     the path to the top level directory of the DIET CMakeLists.txt hierarchy,
   - DIET CVS_DIET_HOME/Bin is a recommended out of source build directory,
   - The configuarion through the GUI goes:
     cd CVS_DIET_HOME/Bin
     ccmake ..
       * hit c (equivalent of bootstrap.sh)
       * Toggle/specify the following parameters
         CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  (for avoiding default /usr/local)
         DIET_USE_JXTA
       * hit c for checking requires dependencies
       * While they are
         [
              (paramaters preceeded with a *)
           or (parameters whose value is terminated by NOT-FOUND)
         ]
         - provide the necessary information
         - hit c to configure
       * hit g to generate the makefile
       * hit q to exit ccmake
     make
     make install

VI/ DIET specific cmake parameters
  - Watch out: neither DIET_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION , nor DIET_USE_FAST bolean
    togles are [yet] effective ! (both defaulted to OFF)
  - DIET_BUILD_EXAMPLES for ... building examples
  - DIET_USE_JXTA for ... compiling with JXTA
  - OMNIORB4_DIR is the path to the omniORB4 installation directory
    (only relevant when omniORB4 was not installed in /usr/local).
    Example: cmake .. -DOMNIORB4_DIR:PATH=/usr/local/omniORB-4.0.5
