DIET (Distributed Interactive Engineering Toolbox) is a middleware designed 
for high-performance computing in a heterogeneous and distributed environment 
(workstations, clusters, grids, clouds).
DIET is licensed under CECILL-A License (GPLv2-like)

DIET was created and is still actively improved and updated by an open-source 
community led by the GRAAL research team and the SysFera company.
 The latter proposes SysFera-DS, a software suite whose core is based on DIET, 
as well as commercial support.
