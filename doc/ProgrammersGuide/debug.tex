Chapter actually in writing. It mostly contains remarks.

\section{Using \diet using Valgrind}

When using Valgrind on the client of the file\_transfer example, you
will certainly see things like the following:

\begin{verbatim}
==18832== Syscall param socketcall.sendto(msg) points to uninitialised byte(s)
==18832==    at 0x458683C: sendto (in /lib/tls/libc-2.3.6.so)
==18832==    by 0x45A43DE: getifaddrs (in /lib/tls/libc-2.3.6.so)
==18832==    by 0x44568C7: omni::tcpTransportImpl::initialise() (in /usr/lib/libomniORB4.so.0.6)
==18832==    by 0x440B887: omni::omni_giopEndpoint_initialiser::attach() (in /usr/lib/libomniORB4.so.0.6)
==18832==    by 0x43A984F: CORBA::ORB_init(int&, char**, char const*, char const* (*) [2]) (in /usr/lib/libomniORB4.so.0.6)
==18832==    by 0x405EB4F: ORBMgr::init(int, char**, bool) (ORBMgr.cc:94)
==18832==    by 0x404799A: diet_initialize (DIET_client.cc:429)
==18832==    by 0x804899D: main (client.c:74)
==18832==  Address 0xBEF612B9 is on thread 1's stack
\end{verbatim}

Do not be afraid of such, the response lies at
\url{http://www.omniorb-support.com/pipermail/omniorb-list/2005-September/027043.html},
where you can find:

\verb!``OmniORB does not initialise padding bytes in messages,!

\verb!which causes valgrind warnings such as these.!

\verb!This is normal[..]''!
