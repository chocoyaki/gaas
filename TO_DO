Client
-------

Implement the request for SeD contract validity.

Asynchronous API should be implemented.
  It is specified that each request is processed on the client by a specific
  thread that runs until the server has finished the computation.
  Maybe this should be managed by the MA only.


SeD
----

Include contract properties in decision type.
Implement contract checking on client and server + resources allocation.


MA
---

Only one server is answered by the MA. To change.


FAST
-----

FAST calls should be OK, but slimfast interface should be updated with new corba
and DIET data structures.


CONFIGURE
----------

Buggy when launched from another directory than the DIET root.
