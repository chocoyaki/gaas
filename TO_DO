Client
-------

Implement the request for SeD contract validity.

Asynchronous API should be implemented.
  It is specified that each request is processed on the client by a specific
  thread that runs until the server has finished the computation.
  Maybe this should be managed by the MA only.


SeD
----

Include contract properties in decision type.
Implement contract checking on client and server + resources allocation.

Implement a forking version of the solve method.
Develop a batch system API.


MA
---

Only one server is answered by the MA. To be changed.


FAST
-----

FAST calls should be OK, but slimfast interface should be updated with new corba
and DIET data structures.
SeD must ask NWS (through FAST) if there is enough memory on the server.


OTHERS
-------

FILE TRANSFER !!!! Must use streaming, better than loading the file in RAM.
Use openSSL omniORB support for all communication (under option)
