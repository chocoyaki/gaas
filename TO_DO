Client
------

Modify the SeD contract check phase.  Either remove the check or
perform a check that is more useful.

When canceled, the client should contact the SeD to abort the execution.

If client submits a data stored in RAM, and if DIET has chosen a
parallel or a batch SeD to execute the job, store data in a file then
make the call.

SeD
----

Modify the SeD contract check phase.  Either remove the check or
perform a check that is more useful.

Implement a batch system API.       [in process by Yves Caniou]
Implement a batch prediction perf.  [in process by Yves Caniou]

Modify resource information collection.  Adopt useful aspects of FAST directly
in DIET, add separate interfaces to collect NWS data, and augment collection
with other info systems like Ganglia.

If possible, make a client request a job to a SeD in parallel of the
data submission, not after like it is done now. This can be useful for
batch SeD.

OTHERS
-------

File transfer could be implemented with streaming to provide better perf 
than loading the file in RAM.

OpenSSL communications should be enabled for all CORBA communications.

Client should be able to submit job to server via a designated agent in the
hierarchy (who would act as a proxy).  This approach could help avoid a lot of
firewall problems between the client and the server.

[2006-12-4 ALTPREDICT removal]
   The ALTPREDICT (Alternative performance PREDICTion) related code should be
   deprecated according to both Holly Grail and Eddy Carron. This code not
   only seems no longer maintained (read dead) but it also collides with
   JuXMEM: ALTPREDICT uses the DTM data structure and doesn't support the
   JuxMEM extension.
   Note: the ALTPREDICT code is delimited by the HAVE_ALTPREDICT
         C-preprocessing flag. Watch out for the occurences within de idl
         sections of code (src/CORBA/idl/*.idl files).
