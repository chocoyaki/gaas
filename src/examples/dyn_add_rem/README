This example presents the functionality to dynamically create and
destroy a service.

- server : takes as parameters a DIET SeD configuration file.
- client : takes as parameters a DIET client configuration file,
the service number to
call(the first one that is created on the
     server is number 0), and the number of services to spawn.

Each time a service is called, it will create the given number of new
services, and will then destroy itself.
A SeD can still be running without any service available .
