A simple basic example on how to use the batch API is given here : no
                                                            IN or INOUT args,
the client receives as a result the number of
processors on which the service has been executed.

More elaborated ones can be found in subdirectories :

1) where data are
involved(file_transfer)

2) where a batch server can really handle generic deployment-- same
code independently of the batch
frontend(TestAllBatch)

3) where Cori Batch is used Cori_cycle_stealing

4) where Cori Batch with performance
prediction(TODO)
