# This small set of utilities is assembled here in order to provide a small
# toolbox for troubleshooting [e.g. is some pesky FW in between ? ]
#   - LightClient/ contains a tiny java client for making simple request
#     on a server:port given with the GUIs
#     
# The typical usage goes:
#   1/ configure cmake with USE_DART option on.
#   2/ compile diet
#   3/ trigger a minimalistic omniNames servers by lauching (from cmake
#      build directory):
#       src/Testing/OmniDaemon.bash start
#   4/ Launch the java LightClient and make requests
#   5/ Halt the omniNames server (again from cmake build directory):
#       src/Testing/OmniDaemon.bash stop
