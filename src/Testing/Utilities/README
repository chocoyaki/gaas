# This small set of utilities is assembled here in order to provide a small
# toolbox for troubleshooting [e.g. is some pesky FW in between ? ]
#   - OmniServerTest.sh launches a small minimalistic omniNames server
#   - LightClient/ contains a tiny java client for making simple request
#     on a server:port given with the GUIs
#     
# The typical usage goes:
#   1/ Edit OmniServerTest.sh and provide simple configuration information
#      [name of the service, ports...]
#   2/ Launch the client and make requires
#   3/ CRTL-C on the server
