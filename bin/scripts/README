This directory contains utilities for packaging DIET. Here are some notes
for the packager:
 - obtain the last cvs version under DIET_CVS
 - Build the documentation with cmake under DIET_CVS/Bin [for the time
   being this cannot be made on graal because the headings extension of
   LaTeX's package "fullpage" is not properly installed].
 - copy the resulting documentations (and included PostScript files) to
   DIET_CVS,
 - cd DIET_CVS
 - ./bin/scripts/make_dist.pl
 - The result is placed under the cwd with name:
     diet-<major>.<minor>.tar.gz (e.g. diet-2.2.tar.gz)
